# LootGames #

This mod provides an interesting and slightly more difficult way to obtain the loot.

In your world you will find new structure, that spawns just below ground level. And inside this structure you are
invited to play one of the minigames. The rule is simple: the better you play the game, the more loot you will get!
And then you say: "Well, what if I lose?" - "It's extremely (or sometimes not so extremely) dangerous to check".

Note: To break the game board in creative mode press Shift + Left Click.

## Current Minigame List:

- ### Game of Light
  Here you should pass 4 levels. You have 3 attempts to do it by default. When you pass one of 4 levels, you will
  definitely win 1 chest (same for all levels). All chests you will get after the game ends. And yeah... don't be afraid
  of losing fourth level. :D

- ### Minesweeper
  You know this game! Mark the bombs with flags and reveal safe fields to win. Four levels and three attempts are
  waiting for you to play!
    - Left-clicking reveals the field. Beware of bombs!
    - Right-clicking on hidden field marks it (switches between no mark, flag and question mark).
    - Shift + Right-clicking on revealed field with number will open all neighbour fields around it, except marked ones.
